# Motivation
This repository showcases the use of state machines to modelize user interfaces. The chosen 
technologies are :
 - [vue 2.x](https://vuejs.org/) for templating and rendering
 - [state-transducer](https://github.com/brucou/state-transducer) as state machine library
 - web components in order to have a reusable and portable implementation 

# Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run start
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
